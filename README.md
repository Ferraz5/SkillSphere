# SkillSphere

**SkillSphere** is an interactive web application for showcasing developer profiles, where recruiters can access and explore candidates' skills and experiences. The goal is to provide an easy-to-navigate platform with categories such as soft skills, education, past experiences, and more, all presented dynamically like a streaming platform, but with resumes instead of movies.
